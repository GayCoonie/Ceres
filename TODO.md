# Ceres

bunch of stuff ive got ideas for but have yet to implement, feel free to have a look
through if youd like, and feel free to suggest any ideas youd like put into the game
as mods too

# Todo:

camo joker, wildcards cant be debuffed
investor joker, after small blind lose money, gain more after defeating boss blind
add own blinds
edition maybe
def enhancements
new seals
joker cult
card jokers: chips or + mult for commons
spectral - upgrade rarity of jokers
blinds for new suits

joker ideas:
sunbathing joker- cards gain bonuses longer kept in hand

1 more suit
illusion cards
chance to lose enhancement

royal flush joker

joker that swaps chips and mult for a hand

temperance, money for money spent this ante
wheel of fortune
chance for neg

unstable chance to split into 2 cards

food joker loses x chips on spending money

joker combines hands and discards letting you use either for either

blind for new suits

joker lets you select same card twice
joker that flips and shuffles hand but does smth strong
joker that balances hands and discard like plasma deck

-jokers based on boss blinds-
deafeating boss blind gives you its chip, up to one of each
chip gives bonus opposite of boss
do what the boss blind does, give bonus

chance to not consume hand or discard joker

pair of jokers, both give negative x mult, 
double sided, cards cant be flipped

compat: talisman x chips

5 hands
only play 1 card
then 2 
then 3 blind

stuff to get done for first release
2 blinds for suits - done yippee
redo illusion cards - done yippee
inject tarot reversals into tarot pools - done yippee
make everything toggleable - done yippee
run through and check everything over ig
test with mainly cryptid and some other mods - kinda done yippee
make trading card work - done yippee
test editions again - done yippee
play two pair and get $4

# more to do
remove planets
change ben effect
then everything implemented is working
more jnokers

# jokers

# commons

If no other Jokers provide XMult, X2 Mult
Club Sandwich If highest and lowest rank of a played hand are both clubs, this joker gains +3 mult. 
large joker, +50 chips, +10 mult if cards in hand total at least 40

# uncommon

Skateboard -For each unique Hand Type played, gains 1x Mult. Resets when a duplicate hand is played.
Fisherman (uncommon) - After playing a hand, increase hand size by 1. Resets at the end of round
Wanted Poster If you get [Joker], +x1 mult. Joker changes when target joker is bought. (Can't pick legendary jokers or undiscovered jokers) rarity tho

Would probably have an unlock condition, that requires you to have a certain amount of jokers discovered, so it's not too op with low discovered joker amounts. 


# vouchers

Mirror + Shattered Mirror vouchers - 2x / 4x chance for negative jokers to appear
