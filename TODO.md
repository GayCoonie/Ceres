Back to Basics (Commonw Only)

Start with a Negative Eternal Showman, but all uncommon and rare jokers are banned. You got to make it work with the bunch of cards that populate the game and you probably ignore on your run, especially in the back half. It’s not IMPOSSIBLE, if people can beat stuff like Jokerless, but it does force you to essentially look at jokers you would otherwise overlook to try and make them work.

(Making the commons negative felt like a bit much, so it’s just Commons only)

# decks

gold deck, money for cards left in hand

For the record - I call it Scratch Deck cause the back of the card would visually resemble a match-box.
cheaper shop items to start and more frequent editions - but rerolling's more pricey

# boosters
Jumbled Packs - these just have a combination of all the tarots, planets, spectral and playing cards.

# blinds
Sunset Clock - discard all cards

# decks
deck of each suit
tattered deck of spades etc

# balancing

colourblind nerf
upgrade negative voucher
maybe diver

# fixes

clock
double down

# POLISHED OFF STUFF (FOR NOW)

- seals
- spectrals
