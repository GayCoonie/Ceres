bunch of stuff ive got ideas for but have yet to implement, feel free to have a look
through if youd like, and feel free to suggest any ideas youd like put into the game
as mods too

# Todo:

camo joker, wildcards cant be debuffed

blinds for new suits

1 more suit
illusion cards
chance to lose enhancement

joker that swaps chips and mult for a hand

temperance, money for money spent this ante
wheel of fortune
chance for neg

unstable chance to split into 2 cards

food joker loses x chips on spending money

joker combines hands and discards letting you use either for either

blind for new suits

joker lets you select same card twice
joker that flips and shuffles hand but does smth strong

-jokers based on boss blinds-
deafeating boss blind gives you its chip, up to one of each
chip gives bonus opposite of boss
do what the boss blind does, give bonus

chance to not consume hand or discard joker

pair of jokers, both give negative x mult, 
double sided, cards cant be flipped

compat: talisman x chips

5 hands
only play 1 card
